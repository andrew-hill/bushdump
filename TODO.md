# TODO

- [ ] Add more graceful error handling to avoid large trace outputs from reasonably
      expected issues.
- [ ] Bring MP4 validation in line with JPEG validation.
- [ ] Improve JPEG pixel-corruption detection: `corrupt-scan-zeros.jpg` and
      `corrupt-scan-flip.jpg` in `tests/fixtures/corrupt-jpegs/` currently pass
      validation because libjpeg's error concealment fills in corrupted MCUs with
      plausible-looking repeated rows. Would need to detect large runs of identical
      MCU rows or similar heuristic to catch partial-download / bit-flip corruption.
- [ ] Add deletion of old files on the SD card. I want to guard this strongly against
      data loss, e.g. getting the user to specify a date to which they have backed up
      files (only older ones are deleted). And for confirmation at time of deletion,
      also check the sizes/dates/IDs match (best verification we can without re-download).

## Next-visit camera smoke tests

### `bd sync --retry`

- [ ] After a normal sync, manually create a `.error.txt` sidecar for one of the
      already-downloaded files (e.g. `touch 20260510T130001_00000001.jpg.error.txt`
      next to the matching file in the output dir).
- [ ] Run `bd sync` without `--retry` — confirm the file is NOT re-downloaded
      (it's below the watermark).
- [ ] Run `bd sync --retry` — confirm the file is re-downloaded, `[retry]` appears
      in the output line, and the sidecar is gone afterwards.

### Health checks

- [ ] With a camera on solar/ext power (reporting 0% battery), confirm no
      battery-low warning fires (`check_battery` suppresses 0%).
- [ ] Run `bd sync <name> --log auto` and inspect the log file: warning lines
      should be plain `  ! ...` with no ANSI escape codes; on the terminal they
      should appear yellow (warn) or red (alert).
- [ ] Confirm `bd stats` completes without error even if `/cmd/info/4` returns
      an unexpected shape — clock check should be silently skipped, not fatal.

Things to confirm on hardware next time each camera is in range.
Update `docs/camera-models.md` with findings afterwards.

### GardePro E6PMB

- [ ] Confirm video download — need videos on the SD card; check `bd ls` for
      any `type 2` files, or trigger a recording
- [ ] Confirm `bd stats` shows a non-zero battery percentage on battery-only
      power (no external solar) — verifies the `voltage`/`battery` fallback
- [ ] review output of `bd settings` (raw log on file: `bd-settings-east.log`;
      `/cmd/getParaSetting` shows valid values for each field)

### GardePro E8 2.0 Pro

- [ ] Confirm video download — check `bd ls` for type 2 files
- [ ] Confirm `bd stats` shows a non-zero battery percentage on battery-only
      power (no external solar) — verifies the `voltage`/`battery` fallback
- [ ] review output of `bd settings` (raw log on file: `bd-settings-norw.log`;
      `/cmd/getParaSetting` shows valid values for each field)
